# 2. Operators and statements

## 2.1 Numeric promotion

Numeric promotion rules:
* If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the larger of the two data types
* If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, integral will automatically be promoted to the floating-point value’s data type
* Smaller data types (byte, short, char) are promoted to int any time they’re used with a binary arithmetic operator, if both operand are of that types (+, -, *, /, %)
* After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value will have the same data type as its promoted operands

```java 
int x = 1;
long y = 33;

x * y; // the result is long
```

```java 
short x = 10;
short y = 20;

x * y; // the result is int
```

```java 
short x = 10;
float y = 20;
double z = 30;

x * y / z; // the result is double
```

***

Assigning a small data type to a larger data type is okay.
When assigning a large data type to a smaller one we need to cast it.

```java
short x = 12;
int y = x;
byte z = (byte) x; 
byte w = y; // won't compile, needs cast
```

Casting is needed when:
* Assigning from larger data type to a smaller one
* Converting from a floating point number to an integral one

***

```java
int i = 5;
double d = 5.0;

System.out.println(i == d);
// prints true, because i is casted to double
```

***

In Java only boolean values can be passed to if, switch and all loop statements: 
```java
int i = 1;
boolean b = true;
boolean b2 = false;

if (b) {
    System.out.println("Good"); // prints Good
}

if (i) { // won't compile
    System.out.println("Bad"); 
}

if (b2 = true) { // assigns true to b2 then returns b2's value, which is true
    System.out.println("Excellent"); // prints Excellent
}
```

## 2.2 Swtich statement

A switch statement may contain:
* byte, short, int, char (and their wrappers)
* enum, String

case values data types must match the switch data type

case values must be a compile-time constant, can't be a method argument

## 2.3 break statement

break statement exits the loop, to exit an outter loop, the following syntax should be used:
```java
OUTTER: for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; i < m; j++) {
        if (a[i][j] < 0) {
            break OUTTER;
        }
    }
}
```
